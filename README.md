# Virtual-Voice-Assistant
In this project, I created a voice assistant that takes voice commands from user and navigates the computer based on their wishes. 
It can open various drives on your PC, play music or movies from your storage, open applications, voice out the date and time, 
perform web scraping, play online music, send Emails, take notes and repeat them when asked, etc. 
It is based on the "pyttsx3" library in Python which converts text to speech. 
It also uses the "speech_recognition" module to capture the users voice and convert it into text to execute the command.
